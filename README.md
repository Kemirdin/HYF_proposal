Start HTML/CSS:
- The division of labor between HTML and CSS

#### Week 2
11.30 - 13.30:

- CLI, [lecture 1](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine/blob/master/Lecture-1.md)
    - all students install gitbash (which is emulation of UNIX like bash on Windows), Mac and Linux users already have a terminal
    - With Gitbash, every single student can execute and see the same commands with same output. Also Gitbash is later used to teach Git.
    - To know the terminal/bash/command line for UNIX based systems. (cd, ls, mkdir, cp and useful bash constructs)
    - Navigate the file system without using a UI explorer.
    - Copy, rename and move files with terminal commands.  

After the break:
- Responsive web design
- Media queries
- Flexbox
- How to use the inspector

#### Week 3
11.30 - 13.30:
- CLI, [lecture 2](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine/blob/master/Lecture-2.md)
    - Learn output redirection, piping on the terminal.
    - Write basic shell scripts to ease the programming life.


After the break:
- Student presentations
- Last week recap and questions
