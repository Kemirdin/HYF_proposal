# Propsal planning class12

## JavaScript 1/Git/ debugging

#### Week1
- CLI session
- Intro JavaScript (What is it, where can you use it for)
- Variables [var, let, const]
- Basic Data types [Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Booleans]
- Operators

#### Week2
- Cli session
- Advanced data types [Objects]
- Conditions
- Statements vs Expressions
- Loops (for/while)
- Functions
- Naming conventions

#### *Debugging lecture (online lecture during week 2)*
- TODO

#### Week3
> JavaScript in the BROWSER with HTML and CSS

- Capturing user input
- Basic DOM manipulations [img src, innerHTML]
- Code debugging using the browser
- Code commenting
- Structuring code files

#### *Debugging lecture (online lecture during week 3)*

## JavaScript 2
#### Week4
- Git (lecture 1 and 2)
- https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-1.md
- https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-2.md

#### Week5
- Functions + JSON/Arrays
- Array Manipulations 
- JSON
- Map and filter
- Arrow functions

> The idea is to let them write arrow functions and use map and filter without going to much in depth about how it work and than the week after come back at the subject while talking about scope and closures

#### Week6
- Closures 
- Scope 
- Events
- Callbacks
- Git [work flow](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md)

> After this Git session students are able to push pull, fork and make PR, this opens up possibilities for handing in homework and cloning repositories we want them to further work on, as homework. Can for example be used in the debugging lectures, where they fork code that they have to debug.

## JavaScript 3
#### Week7
- (Object Oriented Programming)
- Code flow (order of execution)
- Async VS Sync (use api call to illustrate -> fetch)

#### Week8
- Structure for a basic SPA
- XHTTP Requests 
- API calls

#### Week9
- (re)writing data structures (in JSON)
- Promises
